Python code for estimating the geographic location and installation angles of solar PV installations.

Check the included thesis.pdf for additional information. Note that it's unfinished.

Datasets could not be included due to license issues. Datasets might be avalable from FMI at a later date. Or you can email me and ask for them.

This is "research code", beware of bugs and spaghetti.

Email timo.salola@fmi.fi in case you have any questions or suggestions.
